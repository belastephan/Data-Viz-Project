Completed

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze the data base of available hosts on Airbnb from jun08 to aug15 in New York City as well as understand the best type of accommodation and location to be invested in recommended by an investor in order to host their home on Airbnb plataform. Tableau Public was the BI tool used to present the data and insights in a structured way through tableaus, graphs, dashboards and stories visions.

## The Steps
To understand the data set It has been carried out data consolidation analysis about offer, demand and average occupancy per type of accommodation and district.  It was observed that for the offer and demand KPIs the highest concentration happened in apartments and houses categories based in Manhattan and Brooklin distritcs. In order to respond the project’s aim two strategies were applied: revenue/cash flow and profitability/margin. 

## Conclusion
It was concluded that for the first strategy, that is thinking about revenue/cash, the best investment is in an apartment with private room in State Island. In this situation, it will cost about U$ 300k for an investor and the average price suggest per day to rent this apartment is about U$ 43,75. 

For the second strategy, that is thinking about profitability/margin, the best investment is in a chalet in Manhattan. On that situation, that is thinking about profitability/margin, it will cost about U$ 500k for an investor and the suggestion is charge for rent below that the ones that exists and offer good quality accommodation conditions for a good evaluation as well as the others exists.
