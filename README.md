## Project Status

Completed

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze the data base of available hosts on Airbnb from jun08 to aug15 in New York City as well as understand the best type of accommodation and location to be invested in recommended by an investor so hosts may set up their accomodations on Airbnb plataform. Tableau Public was the BI tool used to present the data and insights in a structured way through tableaus, graphs, dashboards and stories visions.

## The Steps
To understand the data set it has been carried out data consolidation analysis about offer, demand and average occupancy per type of accommodation and district.  It was observed that for the offer and demand KPIs the highest concentration happened in apartments and houses categories based in Manhattan and Brooklin distritcs. In order to respond the project’s aim two strategies were applied: revenue/cash flow and profitability/margin. 

## Conclusion
It was concluded that for the first strategy, the one about revenue/cash, the best investment is in an apartment with a private room in State Island. In this situation, it will cost about U$ 300k for an investor and the average price suggested to rent this apartment per day is about U$ 43,75. 

For the second strategy which focuses on thinking about profitability/margin the best investment is in a chalet in Manhattan. In that situation, it will cost about U$ 500k for an investor and the suggestion is to charge below the rental prices on the market nowadays and offer good quality accommodation conditions to achieve competitive reviews in comparison to other acommodations available.
